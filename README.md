## Hi there! My name is Ian, welcome to my github! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a recent Mathematics graduate with a background in Quantitative Analysis and Data Analysis. I mostly work with Python! Using Python, I can pull data straight from the internet and read the story written within. Whether it is pursuing my own Math ideas, analyzing the stock market, or creating my own dashboards, I love fitting the pieces of the puzzle together to reveal the bigger picture. Depending on the needs of my team, I also can create my own shareable .exe software! I hope the various projects showcased here are as entertaining to you as they were for me when I was creating them. Feel free to browse my work and thank you for your time ðŸ˜Š
